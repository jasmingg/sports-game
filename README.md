This is a short 3 hour long project that I created to help me further my research and progress in javascript, html, and css

Basically a counter for points on each side of a team. there's a 10 second timer for each game (short for a real game, but the time limit was just to show the functionalities quicker)
Learned more about functions, constructors, the DOM, javascript logic, html logic, if, if else, and else statements, and finally how to implement a timer.

files:
cursed-timer files are for the font used for the points display and buttons
2 audios for when adding points and when the game ends
3 files of code in javascript, html, and css
I don't really know what the speciman is and where it came from, but it's too late to delete it now...
